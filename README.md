### How to contribute
If you'd like to add to this repository, you can do so in the following ways:

1. If you have a github account - definitely the easiest way to contribute.
  * If you'd like to edit this 'README' file, click on the file's name in the github browser. Then, when you're looking at this file directly, click the little pencil 'edit' button in the top right. You'll be able to make changes in [markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). When you're done, 'commit' the changes. This will initiate a 'pull request' by github, which can then be integrated to the main repository.
  * If you're uncomfortable editing the file directly, you can create a github 'issue' instead, and somebody else will make the change for you. You can access that in the selection bar above.

2. You don't have a github account
  * Join the [Madison Game Dev Slack](https://madisongamedev.slack.com/messages/gamedev/) and request your change there.
